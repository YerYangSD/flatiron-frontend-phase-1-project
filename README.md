## How Does this app Work?

This is a simple application I have created called "FruitNutriGuide." Users can use it as a guide to choosing fruits they may want to eat. Users can select one or more fruit from the multi-dropdown and then click the submit button to show the fruit image and nutrition information below. The nutrition information will be hidden at first. To show the it, click the "Show Nutrition Info" button. To hide it, click the "Hide Nutrition Info" button. To select multiple fruits, hold down the control key(command key in mac) and left click the fruit name in the multiple-dropdown.

## Installation

Since this app has not been deploy to the public, it can not be access like others such as _google.com_ or _facebook.com_. It has to be **fork** from **github** and **clone** to a local computer to be able to use it. Once it has been cloned locally, navigate to the file and open it in an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) such as Visual Studio Code. This app fetches data from http://localhost:3000/fruits (local server). Running the command line _json-server --watch db.json_ will excute json-server tool and watch the json file for changes. Then, run the command line _explorer.exe index.html_ to open the document in your defualt browser. From there, you'll have access to the app.
